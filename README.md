# JS Frameworks Course Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief

Create either a new React or Next.js app in this repo.

For the login functionality, use either a Wordpress installation with the JWT plugin from Module 3 installed, or a Strapi installation. Do not add either of these to your repo. Your API should remain a separate project. The markers will use their own installations when marking.

You can use either a REST or GraphQL API for the API calls.
